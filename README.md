# NNprediction

This example has been modified from : https://medium.com/@benjamin.phillips22/simple-regression-with-neural-networks-in-pytorch-313f06910379

We modified learning process into a single pass learning (no epoch) with moving horizon or sliding window.
This learning concept is suitable for the data streams machine learning problem.
